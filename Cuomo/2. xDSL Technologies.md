DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) is a technology that provides data transmission over the wires of a local telephone network. There are a lot of families:
- IDSL: ISDN Digital subscriber line 
- HDSL: High data rate DSL
- SDLS: Symmetric DSL, Standardized version of HDSL 
- ADSL: Asymmetric DSL
- RADSL: Rate Adaptive DSL 
- VDSL: Very High speed DSL
- VDSL2: Second Version of DSL 
 
 Parts or all of DSL links between CO and users are built with copper cables. This think implies that bandwidth is a function of meters between curb and user, because on copper cables there are loss on long distances.

# ADSL

Asymmetric DSL provides data rate higher in one direction than other for this reason is called Asymmetric. Is built on copper wires cables and provides telephone service and networking services on the same line. 
Older ADSL can deliver 8 Mbit/s to the customer over about 2 km of unshielded twisted pair copper wire. The latest standard ADSL2+ can deliver up to 24 Mbit/s. 

## Frequency Bands

ADSL uses 2 separate frequency bands, one for upstream and the other for downstream. Another frequency bands is used for telephone service.
With standard ADSL, the band from 25.875 kHz to 138 kHz is used for upstream communication, while 138 kHz â€“1104 kHz is used for downstream communication

### Frequency Allocation

There are two techniques used for divides upstream & downstream frequency: 
- **Frequency division:** X frequency are used for upstream and Y frequency are used for downstream, where X != Y
- **Eco Cancellation:** The frequency allocated for Upstream are used also from Downstream and vice versa. For this type of division is necessary the use of a echo cancellation algorithm for the managing of the streams. 
## Cross talks

![[Pasted image 20240122101648.png|500]]
Wires sharing cause interference between cables because the cables are un-shielded.  
There are two types of cross talk noise: 
- NEXT
- FEXT
Crosstalk noise depend on: 
- The power of spectral density of the transmitted signal 
- The number of twisted pairs in the same cable
- The overlapping of bandwidths of the useful signal and the interfering ones
### FEXT

![[Pasted image 20240122113412.png]]
FEXT (far end cross talk) is the cross talk between a transmitter and a receiver placed on opposite sides of the cable. 
FEXT signals travel the entire length of the channel. 
To reduce this kind of noise a cable doesn't contain more than a dozen twisted pair 
### NEXT

NEXT is the cross talk between a transmitter and a receiver placed on the same side of the cable. This kind of cross talk exist when the downstream frequency of receiver is in conflict with the upstream frequencies of the transmitter. For this reason the frequencies are divided.

### Splitter

At the end, for ADSL is necessary install a splitter at the customer premises to avoid interferences with voice service. The splitter is a low pass filter. This splitter is installed before connecting the line to phone and DSL modem. 

## Modulations

In ADSL there are two types of modulations: 
- CAP, that we have seen before
- DMT, that are a new technology used for modulate the signal. 

### DMT

![[Pasted image 20240122120039.png]]

DMT (discrete multi-tone) divide the frequencies in 256 sub-bands of 4,3125 kHz each independent from another. Independent sub-channels can be manipulated individually with consideration of the line conditions. 
for example, if a sub-channel is experiencing external interference it may not be used in favor of the other sub-channel.

The variable use of the channels permits to dynamically adapt the data rate to the line conditions. 

## Architecture

# VDSL

VDSL pushes to the limit what can be transmitted over 24-gauge copper pairs

## Architecture

Higher frequencies causes higher cross talk, for this reason vectoring is necessary

## Vectoring

Vectoring is a technique that eliminate cross talk. It works in this way: 
- The DSLAM at curb measures the noise on the line
- Estimate the cross talk
- Apply adjustement to the signal that eliminate cross talk.
