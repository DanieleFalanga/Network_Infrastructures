DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) is a technology that provides data transmission over the wires of a local telephone network. There are a lot of families:
- IDSL: ISDN Digital subscriber line 
- HDSL: High data rate DSL
- SDLS: Symmetric DSL, Standardized version of HDSL 
- ADSL: Asymmetric DSL
- RADSL: Rate Adaptive DSL 
- VDSL: Very High speed DSL
- VDSL2: Second Version of DSL 
 
 Parts or all of DSL links between CO and users are built with copper cables. This think implies that bandwidth is a function of meters between curb and user, because on copper cables there are loss on long distances.
