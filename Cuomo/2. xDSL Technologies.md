DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) is a technology that provides data transmission over the wires of a local telephone network. There are a lot of families:
- IDSL: ISDN Digital subscriber line 
- HDSL: High data rate DSL
- SDLS: Symmetric DSL, Standardized version of HDSL 
- ADSL: Asymmetric DSL
- RADSL: Rate Adaptive DSL 
- VDSL: Very High speed DSL
- VDSL2: Second Version of DSL 
 
 Parts or all of DSL links between CO and users are built with copper cables. This think implies that bandwidth is a function of meters between curb and user, because on copper cables there are loss on long distances.

# ADSL

Asymmetric DSL provides data rate higher in one direction than other for this reason is called Asymmetric. Is built on copper wires cables and provides telephone service and networking services on the same line. 
Older ADSL can deliver 8 Mbit/s to the customer over about 2 km of unshielded twisted pair copper wire. The latest standard ADSL2+ can deliver up to 24 Mbit/s. 

## Frequency Bands

ADSL uses 2 separate frequency bands, one for upstream and the other for downstream. Another frequency bands is used for telephone service.
There are two techniques used for divides upstream & downstream frequency: 
- **Frequency division:** X frequency are used for upstream and Y frequency are used for downstream, where X != Y
- **Eco Cancellation:** The frequency allocated for Upstream are used also from Downstream and vice versa. For this type of division is necessary the use of a echo cancellation algorithm for the managing of the streams.
