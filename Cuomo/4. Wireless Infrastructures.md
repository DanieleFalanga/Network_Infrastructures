The elements of a a LTE 4G architecture are: 
- **Mobile device** with an IP address
- **Base Station:** it sits at the edge of the carrier's network and is rensposible for managing the the wirelees radio resources and the mobile devices with its coverage area. Base station creates device-specific IP tunnels from the mobile device to gateways. It is called also *"eNode-B"*
- **Home subscriber service (HSS):**  is a database, it stores the information about the mobile devices connected to the network in which  HSS is connected. 
- **Serving Gateway, Packet Data Network Gateway:** They perform the NAT translation of IP address of the devices of the network. 
- **MME:** It authenticate the devices that want to connect to its network. It also setup the tunnels on the data path from/to devices and PDN gateway router and mantains information about an active mobiles device's cell location within the carrier's cellular network.

LTE divides the mobile deviceâ€™s link layer into three sublayers:
- **Packet Data Convergence:**  Perform IP header/compression in order to decrease the number of bits sent over the wireless link.
