# LTE 4G

![[Pasted image 20240125111343.png]]

The elements of a a LTE 4G architecture are: 
- **Mobile device** with an IP address
- **Base Station:** it sits at the edge of the carrier's network and is responsible for managing the the wireless radio resources and the mobile devices with its coverage area. Base station creates device-specific IP tunnels from the mobile device to gateways. It is called also *"eNode-B"*
- **Home subscriber service (HSS):**  is a database, it stores the information about the mobile devices connected to the network in which  HSS is connected. 
- **Serving Gateway, Packet Data Network Gateway:** They perform the NAT translation of IP address of the devices of the network. 
- **MME:** It authenticate the devices that want to connect to its network. It also setup the tunnels on the data path from/to devices and PDN gateway router and maintains information about an active mobiles device's cell location within the carrier's cellular network. 

## LTE protocol stacks

LTE divides the mobile deviceâ€™s link layer into three sublayers:
- **Packet Data Convergence:**  Perform IP header/compression in order to decrease the number of bits sent over the wireless link and encryption and decryption of the IP datagram. 
- **Radio Link Control:** perform 2 importans functions: 
	1. *Fragmenting and Reassembly* of IP datagrams that are too large to fit into the underlying link-layer frames
	2. *Link layer reliable* data transfer at the  through the use of ACK/NACK based ARQ protocol. 
- **Medium Access Control:** The MAC layer perform transmission scheduling. 

## Power Management

A device connected to LTE 4G, if it is not sending or receiving data, can enter in sleeping mode in order to minimize the use of energy. 
There are two types of sleeping mode: 
1) Light sleep: The device check every tot milliseconds the status of connection (data received)
2) Deep sleep: It works at the same type but it checks every 5 o 10 seconds. 

## Mobility 

In 4G LTE has  a "home" network with some cellular provider. The HSS stores infomation about each of its subscribers including global unique device ID, embedded in the SIM card. 
When a device is connected to different network than "home", that device is said to be in roaming on a visited network. 
### Direct and Indirect Routing to/from a Mobile Device
Each device has a global unique identifier called IMSI and an associated phone number, store in the SIM card. For mobile user this would be a permanent IP address in the range of IP's of its home network. 
#### Indirect Routing

Indirect Routing works in this way:
Server => mobile-device
1) Correspondent/Server address the datagram with the permanent address and sends the datagram into the home network. 
2) HHS provides the interaction between the home network and the visited network, so it send through **home network gateway** the packet to **visited network gateway** than sends to the mobile device. 
Mobile device => server
1) **visited network gateway** sends the packet back to the home network gateway or 
2) sends directly to the correspondent

This is not the most efficient way to data exchange. Direct routing is better 
#### Direct Routing

Direct Routing is more efficent but is more complicated to setup. 
It works in this way:
1) Server query to HSS how the datas for communicating with the device
2) HSS answer to him with the datas
3) Server communicates with devices through visited network gateway
This procedure is more complicated to setup. 

### Mobility management in practice

#### Configuring LTE control-plane elements  (Point 1 and 2)

![[Pasted image 20240125153128.png]]

Mobile communicate withs with local MME via BS control plane channel. MME uses mobile's IMSI info to contact mobile's home HSS. MME authenticate mobile, setup encryption and all the network service information. 
After this, HSS knows that mobile is in the visited network. 

#### Configuring data-plane tunnels for mobile (Point 3)

#### Handover between BSs in same cellular network

![[Pasted image 20240125154036.png]]
1) source BS selects target BS and sends to it the Handover request
2) target BS pre-allocates radio time slots and responds with handover ack with info for mobile. 
3) Source BS inform mobile of new BS
4) Source BS stops sending data grams to mobile, instead forwards to new BS
5) new BS inform MME that it is the new BS for mobile, at this point MME inform S-GW to change the tunnel end point to tthe new BS
6) New BS inform source BS that the change is complete
7) Mobile datagrams now flow through new tunnel
