# Network Functional Areas
## Access Network

An access network is that part of a communications network that links subscribers to their ISP.
Today the links between subscribers and ISP used DLS (Digital subscriber loop/line) or **optical fiber**. 
## Core Network

A core network is built with a mesh topology, it provides any-to-any connections among devices on the network. It consists of: 
- Multiple switches (ATM Asynchronous transfer mode) 
- IP routers
Internet could be considered a giant *core network* because it consists of many core networks, one of each ISP.

Significant to core network is "the Edge" where the network and users exists. 

## Edge Network 


The edge perform intelligent functions that are not performed in the core network. If the core network is using MPLS, the edge network can examine the packet and select a patch through the network based on various properties.

Then the core network switch the packet based on instructions provided by *the edge*. 

So: 
Edge -> smart
Core -> dumb
