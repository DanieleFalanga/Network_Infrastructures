Optical Network connects users with optical fiber cables. 
First generation of optical networks are called Passive optical Network because it is composed by passive component like passive splitter. 

Another big difference between first generations of optical network is that the routing, switching and other intelligent function are handled by electronics. 

In the *second generations* of optical network, called WDM-PON, this functions are handled in the optical layer. 

There are two ways to increase the transmission capacity on a fiber:

1) Time division Multiplexing (TDM): Assign time slots to users data packet. This type of technology is used mainly in first generation of Optical Network. 
2) Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM): Divide the traffic in wavelengths, each users has yours. This technique allows the transmission of data simultaneously.

# Second Generation of Optical Networks

The main idea is to incorporate all the intelligent function in the optical domain. 

Another important characteristics is that wavelength can be converted from one wavelength to another.

## Components of a Optical Networks

### OLT (Optical Line Terminals)

Optical line terminals are used at the end of a point-to-point link to multiplex and demultiplex wavelenghts. 

It is composed by three functional elements:
- Transponder
- Wavelength multiplexers 
- Optical amplifiers
